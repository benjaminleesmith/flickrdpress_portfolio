== INTRODUCTION ==

Voltron Portfolio was built to create a professional looking photography
portfolio using pictures from flickr and blog posts from wordpress. Photos are
limited to those in a specific set, and blog posts are limited to those from
a specific rss feed (enabling only posts with a certain tag to be used).

This runs great on Heroku.

== TODO ==

* Add caching of calls to wordpress and flickr
* Mock out calls to wordpress and flickr for development and testing
* Add tests
* Add support for picasa and blogger
